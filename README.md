Spring Dependency Injection (DI) using xml configuration

## The Dependency Injection
The Spring DI is a process whereby objects define their dependencies (that is, the other objects with which they work) only through constructor arguments, arguments to a factory method, or properties that are set on the object instance after it is constructed or returned from a factory method. The container then injects those dependencies when it creates the bean.
